.SH NAME
bwping-client \- The bwping client side tool for measuring maximum UDP bandwidth

.SH DESCRIPTION
bwping-client is part of a client-server tool for measuring bandwidth and response times between two hosts using UDP request/reply mechanism. It requires a client and a server program.

.SH USAGE
Usage: bwping-client -a <IP address> [-p <port>] [-l <length>] [-t <interval_us>] [-d duration] [-c] [-h] [-v] [-s wlan-if] [-r]
    -a ip      : server IPv4 address (required)
    -p port    : server UDP port in use , default = 5001
    -l length  : payload byte length of each packet
                 (see RFC 2544 - 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280 and 1518 bytes)
    -t interval: time between bwping requests in microseconds - default 10 milisseconds
    -d duration: total execution time in seconds - Number of collected samples = duration/interval
    -i interval: time between periodic bandwidth reports in seconds - default 1 second - minimum 0.01 seconds (=10ms)
    -o outfile : record output to file name outfile - overwrite
    -s wlan-if : print received signal and noise power in dBm of interface wlan-if (don't work for APs)
    -r         : print CPU idle and non-idle times
    -6         : connect using IPv6 - default connect with IPv4
    -c         : output in CSV format - Comma Separated Values
                 print the following fields in each line, one line per sample
                 YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, tv_sec.tv_usec, bw, delay, delay_s, jitter, jitter_s, loss, packets_sent, packets_recv, total_sent, total_rcvd, total_diff,
                 [cpuidle_t_local, cpu_nonidle_t_local, cpuidle_t_remote, cpu_nonidle_t_remote]
                 [link_quality_local, signal_local, noise_local, link_quality_remote, signal_remote, noise_remote]

   delay and jitter are shown in seconds
   loss is shown in percentage
   bw (bandwidth) is shown in bytes per second (Bps)
   packets_sent and packets_recv are the number of packets sent and received in the sample period
   total_sent and total_rcvd are the total number of packets sent and received since the begin of the test
   total_diff = total_sent - total_rcvd
   link_quality_local and link_quality_remote are values between 0 and 100, provided by the driver provider
   signal_local, noise_local, signal_remote, noise_remote are in dBm

Miscellaneous:
    -h: print this help message and quit
    -v: print version information and quit

bwping with no -d duration runs forever!
